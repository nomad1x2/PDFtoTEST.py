    "instructions": " Start off with these simple series of numbers. Number series questions measure your ability to reason without words. To answer these questions, you must determine the pattern of the numbers in each series before you will be able to choose which number comes next. These questions involve only simple arithmetic. Although most number series items progress by adding or subtracting, some questions involve simple multiplication or division. In each series, look for the degree and direction of change between the numbers. In other words, do the numbers increase or decrease, and by how much?",

For example, in the series 1, 5, 3, 7, 5, 9, 7, the pattern is add 4, subtract 2, add 4, subtract 2, and so on. Look carefully for the pattern, and then choose which pair of numbers comes next.

    "instructions": " Here is the first of several sets of analogies. Analogies test your ability to see relationships between words, objects, or concepts. There are many different types of analogy relationships: use or function, part-to-whole, classification, proportion or degree, cause and effect, similarity or difference. In each of these verbal analogies, you will be given a set of two related words, followed by a third word and four answer choices. Of the four choices, you must identify the one that would best complete the second set so that it expresses the same relationship as the first set. A good way to figure out the relationship in a given question is to make up a sentence that describes the relationship between the first two words. Then, try to use the same sentence to find out which of the answer choices completes the same relationship with the third word.",

First, you will be given a list of three \"nonsense\" words and their English word meanings. The question(s) that follow will ask you to reverse the process and translate an English word into the artificial language. Your best approach to this type of question is to look for elements (parts) of the \"nonsense\"words that repeat. This is the best way to translate from the imaginary language to English. For example, if you know that linsmerk means oak tree and linsdennel means oak table, then you know that lins means oak. And, if lins means oak, merk must mean tree, and dennel must mean table. When you discover what a word element means in English, write it down. Then, look for the word elements that appear both on the list and in the answer choices.",

Choice b is wrong because even though there were high sales for a particular February, this does not mean that sales are not higher in other months.

Choice a is incorrect because the writer never makes this type of comparison.

As knitting continues to become more popular and increasingly trendy, it is much more difficult to describe the average knitter. Knitters today might be 18, 28, 40, or 65. They might live in a big urban center and take classes in a knitting shop that doubles as a café or they may gather in suburban coffee shops to support one another in knitting and other aspects of life. They could be college roommates knitting in their dorm room or two senior citizens knitting in a church hall. Even men are getting in the act.

Then make sure you understand the question that is being asked before you choose from the five answer options. Answer questions 482 and 483 on the basis of the information below. According to last week's newspaper, doctors in large cities make more money than doctors in small towns or rural areas. It does not seem fair that just because a doctor's office is in a fancy building or at a fancy address, he or she can charge the patients more. Of course, some medical schools cost more than others, but basically all doctors spend a lot of money and a long time in school. There's no proof that graduates of the more expensive schools practice in big cities and graduates of the less expensive schools practice in small towns. All doctors should charge the same.

    "instructions": " Answer questions 499 through 501 on the basis of the information below. Quinn: Our state is considering raising the age at which a person can get a driver's license to eighteen. This is unfair because the age has been sixteen for many years and sixteen-year-olds today are no less responsible than their parents and grandparents were at sixteen. Many young people today who are fourteen and fifteen years old are preparing to receive their licenses by driving with a learner's permit and a licensed driver, usually one of their parents. It would not be fair to suddenly say they have to wait two more years. Dakota: It is true that people have been allowed to receive a driver's license at sixteen for generations. However, in recent years, the increase in traffic means drivers face more dangers than ever and must be ready to respond to a variety of situations. The fact that schools can no longer afford to teach drivers' education results in too many young drivers who are not prepared to face the traffic conditions of today.",

          "b.": "whether schools ought to provide drivers' education to fourteen- and fifteen-year-old students",
          "c.": "whether the standards for issuing drivers' licenses should become more stringent",
          "d.": "whether sixteen-year-olds are prepared to drive in today's traffic conditions",
          "e.": "whether parents are able to do a good job teaching their children to drive"

        "answer": {
          "d.": "The speakers support their arguments in different ways, but both are concerned with whether sixteen-year-olds should continue to be allowed to receive drivers' licenses."

          "e.": "Dakota discusses the actualities of increased traffic and the decline in the teaching of drivers' education. She doesn't use statistics (choice a). Her argument is not emotion-filled, which rules out choice b. She doesn't mention fairness (choice c) and doesn't tell stories about specific situations (choice d)."
